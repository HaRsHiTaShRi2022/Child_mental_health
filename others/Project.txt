Project Review 1

GAPS:
> there datasets for the children
> no stress monitoring and depression control for the parents for there offspring's
> conversational support for the children
> only general purpose monitoring in smart-watches

DATA:
> Kaggle - Student dataset for depression [ for model ]
> LEMON - fmri, heart-rate, respiration, blood-pressure depression [ for model ]
> MODMA - EEG, Depression diagnosis [ for model ]
> DAIC-WOZ - depression detection [ for chat-bot ]
> Reddit Mental health [ for chat-bot ]
> Counselling dataset [ for chat-bot ]

CHATBOT:
> provide the support to the children
> generate the report and send to parents
> guide the children
> generate the alerts to parents for any inappropriate things

ROADMAP:
> train model on the adult dataset
> give quiz/game to the children and monitor there data
> adjust the model and app
> provide the support to the children and report to the parents using the chatbot
> continues monitoring of the children's using the watch and send alert to parents

ARTIFICIAL Situation:
> game or the questions to trigger anxiety so that we can measure the heart-rate and if possible brain signals
> two quizzes for each round
> music and visuals for relaxing the children's

LIMITATIONS:
> we don't have the way to extract the brain dataset
> we have no way to extract data from the watch

PRECAUTIONS:
> do not add something which children can't answer
> do add something children's cant see
> do add the negative feedback

DATA-COLLECTION:
> form as per the dataset used
> for heartrate 3 session in round of 2
	1 first with normal situations
	2.second with artificial relaxing situation (with music and visuals)
	3.third with artificial stress situation (with copyright free music and quiz)
> Self-report how they feel after each round and session

DELIVERABLE:
> 2 ML model trained on adult data
	1. Trained on text data
	2. Trained on the heart and brain data
> Chatbot
	> Emotional support for children's 
	> monitoring and alerting parents
> Data-collector for personalizing for a particular child
> App to monitor the child for parents

FUTURE:
> dataset for children that can be used for the further enhancement
> wearable device for the children so that parents can monitor there mental health containing the chatbot for support
> app and web support
> paper
